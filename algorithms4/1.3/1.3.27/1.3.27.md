Q: Write a method `max()` that takes a reference to the first node
in a linked list as argument and returns the value of the maximum key in the
list. Assume that all keys are positive integers and return 0 if the list is
empty.

A:

```
public int max(Node first) {
  if (first == null) return 0;
  int max = first.key;
  Node x = first;
  while (x != null) {
    if (max < x.key) max = x.key;
    x = x.next;
  }
  return max;
}
```
