Q: Write a function that takes the first `Node` in a linked list as argument
and (destructively) reverses the list, returning the first node in the result.


A:

```
public Node reverse(Node first) {
  Node list = null;
  while (first != null) {
    Node second = first.next;
    first.next = list;
    list = first;
    first = second;
  }
}
```
